# EV_Vehicle_Charge_Demand
Overview
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends across different counties in the United States. The dataset contains information about EV populations, including battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), along with traditional vehicle counts for comparison.

Dataset
The dataset includes:

20,819 records with 10 features

County and state information

Vehicle types (Passenger, Truck, etc.)

Counts of BEVs, PHEVs, and non-electric vehicles

Percentage of electric vehicles in each area

Data spanning from 2020 to 2022

Key Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing:

Handling missing values in county and state information

Date standardization

Outlier detection and treatment in percentage values

Analysis includes:

Basic statistics and data exploration

Identification of EV adoption patterns

Geographic distribution of electric vehicles

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical operations

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for potential machine learning applications

Potential Applications
This analysis could be used to:

Identify regions with high EV adoption

Track growth trends in electric vehicle usage

Inform infrastructure planning for charging stations

Compare adoption rates between different vehicle types
